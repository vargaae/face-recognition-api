AI detection image analysis | AI visual inspection tool
application with Clarifai API.
This application analyses the loaded image and makes predictions of concepts, that we can use for example for keywords. I designed and developed the NodeJS server application for this AI detection tool and it's connected to the PostgreSQL database and to the client side throught the Routes - REST API and through the encrypted auth services.
